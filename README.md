Overview <br/>
ML Mavericks is a machine learning project developed as part of the Machine Learning and Data Mining coursework. The project analyzes two datasets: the NASA Nearest Earth Objects (NEO) dataset and the Banking Marketing Targets dataset, using various machine learning algorithms to derive valuable insights and improve predictive accuracy.

Datasets<br/>
1)NASA Nearest Earth Objects (NEO) Dataset:<br/>
Contains information about near-Earth objects, including estimated diameter, relative velocity, miss distance from Earth, and hazard classification.<br/>
Objective: Predict whether a near-Earth object is hazardous based on its physical and orbital characteristics.
2)Banking Marketing Targets Dataset: <br/>
Contains data related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, including client demographics, contact details, and campaign outcomes.<br/>
Objective: Predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and historical data.

Algorithms and Methodologies<br/>
The following machine learning algorithms were employed, each evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score:
1)Naive Bayes: Applied to both datasets for probabilistic classification.<br/>
2)Support Vector Machine (SVM): Used kernel functions for non-linear data classification.<br/>
3)Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): A neural network effective for complex, non-linear relationships.<br/>
4)XGBoost: Employed for gradient boosting and achieving high accuracy.<br/>
5)Q-Learning: A reinforcement learning algorithm for optimal strategy learning.<br/>
6)Inductive Logic Programming (ILP): Used for bag-level classification based on aggregated instance information.
